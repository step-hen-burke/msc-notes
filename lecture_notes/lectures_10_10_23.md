## Data Cleaning

Data processing - gaining information from data.
ML / statistics - gain evidence that allows us to make decisions

EDA - Early data analysis (I thought it was exploratory)

We need to communicate our conclusions to stakeholders - using data visualisation 

Pre-cognitive recognition - quick processing for certain types of information - visualisation needs to be clear & exact so the message gets through immediately

Boring / over-complicated visualisations - leads to confusion for stakeholders

- [ ] Justify _everything_ about why plots are chosen & link it back to Tufte - can never be to detailed - back up choices with literature

- [ ] Justify use of gendered colour - Human Computer Interaction - field of study
