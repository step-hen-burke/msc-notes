### Regression

- [ ] Look into R$^{2}$ interpretations for over vs underfitting
"The proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s)"

$R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}$ where $SS_{res}$ is residual sum of squares $\sum\limits_{i}e_{i}^2$, and $SS_{tot}$ is the total sum of squares $\sum\limits_{i}(y_{i}-\bar{y})^2$

## Data Analytics

### CA

- First CA released: due in November.
- Must be submitted on github as well as moodle - word documents, jupyter notebooks only.
- Git needs at least 10 commits
- Link back to the learning outcomes - show why you're doing the things you're doing and put in effort beyond this.
- Population in Ireland 
	- choose an area of interest 
	- collect, process & analyse data etc. 
	- rely on data from CSO and any additional data
	- identify issues/problem's at present and make predictions / classifications into the future
	- Must be about the population - keep it relevant
- [ ] Look at Tuft's principles of data prep and visualization
-  Need to discuss use of programming paradigms
- Jupyter notebook needs to have markdown comment cells
- Follow KDD / CRISP-DM / Some paradigm and structure the report that way
	- [ ] Look into Crisp-DM
	- [ ] Look into KDD
	- [ ] Look into SEMMA
- Must submit the cover sheet
- Don't just replicate a study
- No lit review needed, but it'd be useful to do it
- David's papers are very relevant to his section
	- [ ] Make a note exploring what David's paper selection is getting at
- All code must be in ipynbs, no util functions sourced from python files

### Missing Data

Some situations where we need to impute, but we need to be very clear about when and why we do

If we have a feature that fits very closely to a distribution, mean/median imputation might be appropriate depending
