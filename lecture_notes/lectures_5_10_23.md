## Statistics
### CA Discussion

- Additional data: anything not sourced from CSO, can apply to info in papers etc.
- Statistics visualizations include boxplots, bar charts, histograms etc.
- [ ] Research large samples with discrete distributions: binomial / poisson etc.
- Explain / identify some information in the data using distributions
- Look for change in discrete distributions as data gets large - in stats, over 100 rows is considered "large" -> converges to continuous distribution I suppose
- _Storyline is important to have running through the whole report_
- How do we apply distributions to data and use them? Like why would we need a binomial? - maybe when predicting a binary outcome variable we can compare our model's output to the output of draws from a binomial distribution then test whether our ML model performs better than the null model / random chance?
Maybe I'm misunderstanding but this doesn't seem like a good idea: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/367696/accuracy-of-a-binary-classifier-vs-probability-of-binomial-distribution
