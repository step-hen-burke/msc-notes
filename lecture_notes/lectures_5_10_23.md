## Statistics
### CA Discussion

- Additional data: anything not sourced from CSO, can apply to info in papers etc.
- Statistics visualizations include boxplots, bar charts, histograms etc.
- [ ] Research large samples with discrete distributions: binomial / poisson etc.
- Explain / identify some information in the data using distributions
- Look for change in discrete distributions as data gets large - in stats, over 100 rows is considered "large"
- _Storyline is important to have running through the whole report_
