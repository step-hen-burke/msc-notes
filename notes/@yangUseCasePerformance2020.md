Carried out on time series data - linear interpolation and last seen imputation work well, possibly because missings and actual values in time series are often autocorrelated, but they insert missings randomly. I think the downfalls of last seen in particular would be more apparent in a real time series with missings that are clumped together.

The title says big data analytics but their datasets only have 21 and 1259 rows.
