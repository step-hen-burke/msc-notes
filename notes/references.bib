  abstract = {For more than a century, the methods for data representation and the exploration of the intrinsic structures of data have developed remarkably and consist of supervised and unsupervised methods. However, recent years have witnessed the flourishing of big data, where typical dataset dimensions are high and the data can come in messy, incomplete, unlabeled, or corrupted forms. Consequently, discovering the hidden structure buried inside such data becomes highly challenging. From this perspective, exploratory data analysis plays a substantial role in learning the hidden structures that encompass the significant features of the data in an ordered manner by extracting patterns and testing hypotheses to identify anomalies. Unsupervised generative learning models are a class of machine learning models characterized by their potential to reduce the dimensionality, discover the exploratory factors, and learn representations without any predefined labels; moreover, such models can generate the data from the reduced factors' domain. The beginner researchers can find in this survey the recent unsupervised generative learning models for the purpose of data exploration and learning representations; specifically, this article covers three families of methods based on their usage in the era of big data: blind source separation, manifold learning, and neural networks, from shallow to deep architectures.},

  abstract = {Data quality has become a pervasive challenge for organizations as they wrangle with large, heterogeneous datasets to extract value. Given the proliferation of sensitive and confidential information, it is crucial to consider data privacy concerns during the data cleaning process. For example, in medical database applications, varying levels of privacy are enforced across the attribute values. Attributes such as a patient's country or city of residence may be less sensitive than the patient's prescribed medication. Traditional data cleaning techniques assume the data is openly accessible, without considering the differing levels of information sensitivity. In this work, we take the first steps toward a data cleaning model that integrates privacy as part of the data cleaning process. We present a privacy-aware data cleaning framework that differentiates the information content among the attribute values during the data cleaning process to resolve data inconsistencies while minimizing the amount of information disclosed. Our data repair algorithm includes a set of data disclosure operations that considers the information content of the underlying attribute values, while maximizing data utility. Our evaluation using real datasets shows that our algorithm scales well, and achieves improved performance and comparable repair accuracy against existing data cleaning solutions.},

  abstract = {Data deduplication refers to the process of identifying tuples in a relation that refer to the same real world entity. The complexity of the problem is inherently quadratic with respect to the number of tuples, since a similarity value must be computed for every pair of tuples. To avoid comparing tuple pairs that are obviously non-duplicates, blocking techniques are used to divide the tuples into blocks and only tuples within the same block are compared. However, even with the use of blocking, data deduplication remains a costly problem for large datasets. In this paper, we show how to further speed up data deduplication by leveraging parallelism in a shared-nothing computing environment. Our main contribution is a distribution strategy, called Dis-Dedup, that minimizes the maximum workload across all worker nodes and provides strong theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy by performing extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets with varying block size distributions, as well as real world datasets.},

To get a head start before exploring a new dataset, data scientists often prefer to view existing               EDA notebooks               - illustrative exploratory sessions that were created by fellow data scientists who examined the same dataset and shared their notebooks via online platforms. Unfortunately, creating an illustrative, well-documented notebook is cumbersome and time-consuming, therefore users sometimes share their notebook without explaining their exploratory steps and their results. Such notebooks are difficult to follow and to understand.                          To address this, we present ExplainED, a system that automatically attaches explanations to views in EDA notebooks. ExplainED analyzes each view in order to detect what elements thereof are particularly interesting, and produces a corresponding textual explanation. The explanations are generated by first evaluating the interestingness of the given view using several measures capturing different interestingness facets, then computing the Shapely values of the elements in the view, w.r.t. the interestingness measure yielding the highest score. These Shapely values are then used to guide the generation of the textual explanation.             We demonstrate the usefulness of the explanations generated by ExplainED on real-life, undocumented EDA notebooks.},

  abstract = {Data errors represent a major issue in most application workflows. Before any important task can take place, a certain data quality has to be guaranteed by eliminating a number of different errors that may appear in data. Typically, most of these errors are fixed with data preparation methods, such as whitespace removal. However, the particular error of duplicate records, where multiple records refer to the same entity, is usually eliminated independently with specialized techniques. Our work is the first to bring these two areas together by applying data preparation operations under a systematic approach prior to performing duplicate detection.             Our process workflow can be summarized as follows: It begins with the user providing as input a sample of the gold standard, the actual dataset, and optionally some constraints to domain-specific data preparations, such as address normalization. The preparation selection operates in two consecutive phases. First, to vastly reduce the search space of ineffective data preparations, decisions are made based on the improvement or worsening of pair similarities. Second, using the remaining data preparations an iterative leave-one-out classification process removes preparations one by one and determines the redundant preparations based on the achieved area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR). Using this workflow, we manage to improve the results of duplicate detection up to 19\% in AUC-PR.},

  abstract = {New challenges arise in data visualization when the research involves a sizable database. With many data points, classical scatterplots are non-informative due to the cluttering of points. On the contrary, simple plots, such as the boxplot that are of limited use in small samples, offer great potential to facilitate group comparison in the case of an extensive sample. This article presents exploratory data analysis methods useful for inspecting variation across groups in crucial variables and detecting heterogeneity. The exploratory data analysis methods (introduced by Tukey in his seminal book of 1977) encompass a set of statistical tools aimed to extract information from data using simple graphical tools. In this article, some of the exploratory data analysis methods like the boxplot and scatterplot are revisited and enhanced using modern graphical computational devices (as, for example, the heat-map) and their use illustrated with Spanish Social Security data. We explore how earnings vary across several factors like age, gender, type of occupation, and contract, and in particular, the gender gap in salaries is visualized in various dimensions relating to the type of occupation. The exploratory data analysis methods are also applied to assessing and refining competing regressions by plotting residuals-versus-fitted values. The methods discussed should be useful to researchers to assess heterogeneity in data, across-group variation, and classical diagnostic plots of residuals from alternative models fits.

  abstract = {A statistical method for exploratory data analysis based on 2D and 3D area under curve (AUC) diagrams was developed. The method was designed to analyze electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), and tremorogram data collected from patients with Parkinson's disease. The idea of the method of wave train electrical activity analysis is that we consider the biomedical signal as a combination of the wave trains. The wave train is the increase in the power spectral density of the signal localized in time, frequency, and space. We detect the wave trains as the local maxima in the wavelet spectrograms. We do not consider wave trains as a special kind of signal. The wave train analysis method is different from standard signal analysis methods such as Fourier analysis and wavelet analysis in the following way. Existing methods for analyzing EEG, EMG, and tremor signals, such as wavelet analysis, focus on local time\textendash frequency changes in the signal and therefore do not reveal the generalized properties of the signal. Other methods such as standard Fourier analysis ignore the local time\textendash frequency changes in the characteristics of the signal and, consequently, lose a large amount of information that existed in the signal. The method of wave train electrical activity analysis resolves the contradiction between these two approaches because it addresses the generalized characteristics of the biomedical signal based on local time\textendash frequency changes in the signal. We investigate the following wave train parameters: wave train central frequency, wave train maximal power spectral density, wave train duration in periods, and wave train bandwidth. We have developed special graphical diagrams, named AUC diagrams, to determine what wave trains are characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases. In this paper, we consider the following types of AUC diagrams: 2D and 3D diagrams. The technique of working with AUC diagrams is illustrated by examples of analysis of EMG in patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy volunteers. It is demonstrated that new regularities useful for the high-accuracy diagnosis of Parkinson's disease can be revealed using the method of analyzing the wave train electrical activity and AUC diagrams.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present GDR, a Guided Data Repair framework that incorporates user feedback in the cleaning process to enhance and accelerate existing automatic repair techniques while minimizing user involvement. GDR consults the user on the updates that are most likely to be beneficial in improving data quality. GDR also uses machine learning methods to identify and apply the correct updates directly to the database without the actual involvement of the user on these specific updates. To rank potential updates for consultation by the user, we first group these repairs and quantify the utility of each group using the decision-theory concept of value of information (VOI). We then apply active learning to order updates within a group based on their ability to improve the learned model. User feedback is used to repair the database and to adaptively refine the training set for the model. We empirically evaluate GDR on a real-world dataset and show significant improvement in data quality using our user guided repairing process. We also, assess the trade-off between the user efforts and the resulting data quality.},
