Very dense treatment of generative models - some familiar concepts like PCA, LDA, MDS, VAE, GANs, etc. But a lot of new concepts as well as ones I hadn't come across in a long time. Boltzmann machines were particularly interesting - the whole class of energy based approaches is new to me - they have forward and backward connections, so are difficult to train, but can be powerful.
