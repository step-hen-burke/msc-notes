The authors go into visualisation techniques for large datasets when scatterplots break down; primarily focusing on faceted box and whisker plots. Interestingly, they set the width of the boxes to correspond to the size of the subset. 
They also plot heatmaps of linear model residuals, which is an interesting representation, and talk about methods for dealing with right-censored data, as their Spanish census dataset has a maximum value for income.
