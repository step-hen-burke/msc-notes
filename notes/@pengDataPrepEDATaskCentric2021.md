### Notes 

The authors introduce a package / methodology for efficiently doing data preparation tasks - their visualisations are nice, and interactive using Bokeh. 

They compare multiple backends and eventually settle on Dask, which I didn't realise was as fast as it is. It blows pandas away and outperforms Spark by a good margin.
