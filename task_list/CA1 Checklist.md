	- Compare lasso, ridge, elasticnet 
	- Compare RF-Regressor
	- Compare to ARIMA
	- Refer to CRISP-DM
- [ ] Add annotations / justfication to machine learning section
- [ ] Import and clean town data
	- Probably could get away with two data points - allows for growth feature and demonstrating cleaning
	 - Extract county / townland feature from names -  demonstrates relatively involved data cleaning 
	  - Look at sizes of towns - are they lognormal? Can we extract a town_size variable?
- [ ] Use KNN 
	- Group towns together
	- Compare with naive bayes
- [ ] Find references
