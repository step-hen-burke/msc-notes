- [x] Import and clean town data ✅ 2023-11-06 
	- Probably could get away with two data points - allows for growth feature and demonstrating cleaning
	 - Extract county / townland feature from names -  demonstrates relatively involved data cleaning 
	  - Look at sizes of towns - are they lognormal? Can we extract a town_size variable?
- [x] Use KNN ✅ 2023-11-06
	- Group towns together
	- Compare with naive bayes
