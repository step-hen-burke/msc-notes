### CA
- [ ] Look into questions arising from [[lectures_3_10_23 | this week's lecture]]
- [ ] Read data analytics papers researching population
	- [ ] Find interesting datasets on CSO to have an idea of what's possible
 - [x] Set up CA Git ✅ 2023-10-06

#### CA Overview 
> A large amount of data has been collected by The Central Statistics Office in Ireland in relation to the population of Ireland, This data is available at:[](https://data.gov.ie/organization/dublin-city-council?tags=Transport+and+Infrastructure)
> 
> [https://data.cso.ie/product/pme](https://data.cso.ie/product/pme)
> 
> You are required to choose a particular area of interest and formulate the appropriate questions for modelling and analysis. For Example (but not limited to):
> 
> ● Annual Population Change
> 
> ● Immigration and Migration
> 
> ● Population Forecasting
> 
> ● etc…
> 
> You are required to collect, process, analyse and interpret the data in order to identify possible issues/problems at present and make predictions/classifications in regard to the future. This analysis will rely on the available data from CSO and **any additional data you deem necessary** (with supporting evidence) to support your hypothesis for this scenario.
> 
> This will require you to employ critical analysis of not only the domain of choice but also for the regression and or classification that you undertake.
> 
> **Note: This is an academic exercise and not a hypothetical report to the CSO.**
