- [ ] Email Rory and start off discussion re capstone topic - rbyrne@cct.ie
- [ ] Ask about suitability of DL compression - is it too abstract, does it even have a problem area (embedded systems applications), what would the artefact be or is the body of research sufficient (maybe a methodology outline?), etc. Should research be more "applied" - with an application in mind re problem domain?

First assignment is a short powerpoint presentation - due in 2.5 weeks
- Research title (10) topic area (15) including background and reasoning for choosing the area
- Research Objectives and/or hypotheses (20) and alignment to the topic area (30)
- Proposed domain area and problem area (12.5x2)

- [ ] Pull together some chapters / papers on DNN compression techniques - are there any obvious novel angles or high level papers summarising the SoA

Does the exploration of a dataset / technology in a novel way constitute primary research? Dataset is still secondary....
Primary research asking about model artifact size??? Importance of accuracy vs disk space? Avg internet allowance?
