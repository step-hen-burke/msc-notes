Deep Learning applications using streaming data from IoT devices

Research deep learning models and use-cases that use data streamed from IoT 

Implement a producer (not necessarily an actual IoT) that streams data over something like Kafka or RabbitMQ, process and store with spark streaming for example, and use the results to train a neural network. Eg. data from weather sensors, images from traffic cameras,  telemetry from machinery
