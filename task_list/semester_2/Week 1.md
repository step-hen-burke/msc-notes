# Research & Professional Ethics

- Precursor to the capstone project - resulting in a research proposal
- 60% or higher is generally preferable as a good setup for the project

- [ ] Read section 6.8.3 of capstone project module descriptor - learning outcomes

Not looking for theory of research in assignments - more application of what we learn

- [ ] Start thinking of topic for capstone project

- First assignment due March 10th - issued February 20th - independent from other module CAs
- Second assignment March 12th -> May 12th

Projects should have 3-5 clear objectives - all must be addressed ("If you're addressing the objectives, you're addressing the topic")

Topic is what should be solidified in the proposal

Actions such as lit review, researching, interviews, etc. are not objectives. (They are done in order to meet objectives)

Depth in topic is more desirable than shallow repetition - keep scope relatively narrow

Ideally a project should be novel - adds value to the area of research - novel projects tend to get higher marks

Capstone project is 12-15k words
